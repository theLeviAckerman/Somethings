Dear Yogesh Sir,

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to request approval for 15 days of work from home, starting immediately, due to a critical medical emergency in my family.

My father has recently been diagnosed with three blockages in his heart. Although angioplasty has been successfully performed for one blockage on yesterday, his condition became serious during the procedure, and he is currently admitted to the ICU under continuous medical care. At this moment, he requires constant support and care, and currently I am the only capable family member available to be with him during this critical time.

Given the situation, I kindly request permission to work from home for the next 15 days to ensure I can be there for him while continuing my professional responsibilities.

Please let me know if any additional information or medical documents are required; I would be more than happy to provide them.

I sincerely appreciate your understanding and support during this challenging time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
